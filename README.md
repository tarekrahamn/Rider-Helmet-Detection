We implemented a two-stage deep learning pipeline for automated rider and helmet detection. First, YOLOv8 was used for segmenting two-wheeler riders from images. Then, a VGG16-based classifier detected whether the identified rider was wearing a helmet or not. The dataset was preprocessed with augmentation (resizing, flipping, brightness adjustment), and redundant images were removed to improve accuracy. This hybrid approach ensures precise and reliable helmet compliance detection.

We designed a two-stage deep learning pipeline:

- **Preprocessing**: Removed redundant images and applied augmentation (resizing to 600x600, flipping, brightness +10%).
- **Segmentation**: YOLOv8 detects and segments two-wheeler riders from road images.
- **Classification**: VGG16 classifies whether detected riders are wearing helmets or not.
- This hybrid approach minimizes misclassification and improves compliance detection.
