# Rider-Helmet-Detection
This project utilizes deep learning models YOLOv8 and VGG16 for real-time helmet detection in two-wheeler riders, aiming to improve traffic safety by automating law violator detection. It integrates computer vision to segment riders and classify helmet usage, achieving high accuracy in crowded environments.
