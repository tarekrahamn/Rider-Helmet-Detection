# Rider-Helmet-Detection
This project utilizes deep learning models YOLOv8 and VGG16 for real-time helmet detection in two-wheeler riders, aiming to improve traffic safety by automating law violator detection. It integrates computer vision to segment riders and classify helmet usage, achieving high accuracy in crowded environments.

## üìå Project Overview

This project tackles road safety concerns by automatically detecting two-wheeler riders and verifying helmet compliance using a dual-stage deep learning pipeline:

1. **YOLOv8** ‚Äì Segments riders from real-world traffic images  
2. **VGG16** ‚Äì Classifies cropped segments as *with helmet* or *without helmet*

- **Total Images:** 3,301 (after augmentation)
- **Classes:** `Rider With Helmet`, `Rider Without Helmet`
- **Format:** YOLOv8
- **Prepared Using:** [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com)

## üìä Model Evaluation
The following results are derived from the experimental evaluation conducted in the accepted ICCIT 2024 paper.

| Metric         | YOLOv8 Evaluation Result |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| mAP            | 95%                       |
| Precision      | 99%                       |
| Recall         | 96%                       |
| PR Curve AUC   | 95%                       |
| F1 Score       | 95% @ IoU 0.77            |

**Key Insights:**
- The **YOLOv8** model performs highly reliably in segmenting two-wheeler riders in traffic scenarios.
- The **F1 Score** of 0.95 (at 77% IoU threshold) indicates excellent balance between precision and recall.
- **Precision-Recall (PR) curve** suggests strong model confidence and minimal false positives.

These results demonstrate the robustness of YOLOv8 in real-world conditions for rider detection.
